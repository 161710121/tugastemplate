                    At the beginning of each episode, a voice of Barry Allen describes briefly the hardships that he faced in the past. Barry states that he will use his new powers to fight crime and find the one who killed his mother to bring justice for his father in season one. In season two, Barry states how he must now use his powers to stop the new threats that he accidentally brought into the world after finding his mother's murderer. Season three featured two different intros. The first half sees Barry facing the ultimate consequence from he went back in time to save his mother, which in turn created a new timeline, leaving him facing threats from that timeline who are manifesting powers in the 'real' world. A second version was introduced in "Borrowing Problems from the Future" as Barry attempts to save Iris from getting killed by Savitar right after he witnessed her future death. The fourth season mentions the new threats Barry’s friends brought after they got him out of the Speed Force.
